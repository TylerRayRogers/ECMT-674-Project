# ECMT-674-Project
Develop forecasting models of County level Sales Tax collections in the State of Texas

# Instructions:
Your task for the term project assignment is to develop forecasting models of County level Sales Tax
collections in the State of Texas. The main data for the project is available on the class website in an
Excel workbook “Texas County Sales Taxes.xlsx” with monthly data covering the period December
2012 – February 2021. Data are provided for nine different Texas Counties. Your task is to choose one
of these Counties for the project. You will need to collect and incorporate other data/variables into your
analysis – “leading indicators” for example.
These data are from the Texas Comptroller’s Office and you may find some useful information on their
website: https://comptroller.texas.gov/
Your final project submission should be compiled in a formal report format and should include the
following elements:
1. Overview of the Sales Tax variable
  a. Trend elements
  b. Seasonal elements
  c. Cyclical elements
2. Univariate Forecasting Models
  a. Present your preferred ETS and ARIMA forecasting models for the Sales Tax variable
based on a six-month “hold-out” sample where you forecast into the last six months of
the data (that is, define your “training” set as ending in August 2020).
    i. Present a basic model description for your preferred ETS and ARIMA models
along with residual diagnostics.
    ii. Present a six-month ahead forecast for September, 2020 – February, 2021. How
do your forecasts compare to the actual values for the Sales Tax variable?
    iii. Present a series of 6 one-step-ahead forecasts September, 2020 – February, 2021.
How do your forecasts compare to the actual values for the Sales Tax variable?
    iv. Based on your analysis in i-iii, what is your preferred forecasting model, ETS or
ARIMA?
  b. Using the full dataset and the model you developed in 2.a., present a 12 month ahead path
forecast for March, 2021-Februrary, 2022.
3. Multivariate Forecasting Model
  a. Present some type of multivariate forecasting model based on either:
    i. A set of “leading indicators.”
    ii. A VAR model of the Sales variable plus 2 or more series of your choice.
  b. Your presentation should include a description of why you chose certain variables for
your multivariate model.
  c. Based on your final multivariate model, present a 12 month ahead path forecast of the
Sales Tax variable. How does it compare to your Univariate model forecasts?
